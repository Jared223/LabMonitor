# Lab Monitor - Real-Time Lab Session Tracker for UoN Comp Sci Students

Lab Monitor is a web application built for students of Computer Science at the Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. It provides a real-time display of lab session schedules, dynamically highlighting the lab currently in progress.

## Features

- **Real-Time Schedule**: The timetable updates dynamically to show the current lab session.
- **Year Filter**: Users can filter the displayed labs by academic year.
- **Auto-Updated Clock**: A digital clock is displayed and updated every second.

## How to Use

Simply open the application in your web browser to view the lab sessions for the current week. You can filter the sessions by academic year by clicking the buttons at the top of the timetable.

## Installation

No installation is required for general users as the application runs directly in the web browser.

For developers or those hosting the application:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have a web server installed (like Apache or Nginx).
